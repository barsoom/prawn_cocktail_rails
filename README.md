# PrawnCocktailRails

[![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/barsoom/prawn_cocktail_rails.png)](https://travis-ci.org/#!/barsoom/prawn_cocktail_rails/builds)

Ruby on Rails integration for [PrawnCocktail](http://github.com/barsoom/prawn_cocktail).

## Usage

Please see [PrawnCocktail](http://github.com/barsoom/prawn_cocktail).

PrawnCocktailRails adds a `send_pdf` method to your controllers:

``` ruby
class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    invoice = Invoice.find(params[:id])
    document = InvoiceDocument.new(invoice)
    send_pdf document
  end
end
```

You can change disposition with `send_pdf(document, disposition: "inline")`, without the option it will default to `"attachment"`.

It configures PrawnCocktail to look for its views in `app/views/documents`.

It also adds `app/documents/helpers` to the Rails autoload path so you can put your PrawnCocktail helpers there.

We suggest putting your documents in `app/documents`.

And that's it. The rest is all [PrawnCocktail](http://github.com/barsoom/prawn_cocktail).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'prawn_cocktail_rails'

And then execute:

    bundle

As this library depends on `prawn_cocktail`, you only need to list this one to get both.

### Mime types

You may need to register the pdf mimetype in `config/initializers/mime_types.rb`, for older versions of rails.

```ruby
Mime::Type.register "application/pdf", :pdf
```
